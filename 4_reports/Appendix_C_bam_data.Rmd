![**Figure 1.**  Spatial distribution of BAM point count stations (black dots) north of Bird Conservation Region 12 in Ontario.](P:/projects/ring-of-fire-brt/3_outputs/figures/rof_study_area.png)

## The breakdown of point locations is as follows:  
Total: `r nrow(pts_ss)`  
Hudson Plain Ecozone: `r nrow(pts_plain)`  
Boreal Shield Ecozone: `r nrow(pts_shield)`  

In AOU: `r nrow(pts_aou)`  

Study Area total: `r nrow(pts_ra)`  
Study Area Hudson Plain: `r nrow(pts_ra_plain)`  
Study Area Boreal Shield: `r nrow(pts_ra_shield)`  
Study Area AOU: `r nrow(pts_ra_aou)`  
Study Area Far North: `r nrow(pts_ra_north)`  


# Variables extracted for BAM point count stations within the larger region. This consistst of points in Ontario north of BCR 12. 
All raster variables were standardized to 250m resolution raster values. If original raster was <250m resolution, the mean value among cells was used. 

## Variables (and name in database)
**Elevation** (elevation): height above sea level in meters  
**Tree cover** (treecover): percentage of area covered by tree crowns  
**On road?** (road_yesno): point on road (1) or off road (0)   
**Distance from road** (road_dist_m): distance of pixel containing point from nearest road in meters  
**Adjusted distance from road** (road_dist_m.adj): distance adjusted for width of pixel  
**Distance to mine site** (mine_dist_m): distance of pixel to nearest mine site in meters  
**Slope** (slope): average slope within pixel (degrees)  
**TRI** (TRI): Topographic roughness index -- The topographic ruggedness index (TRI) was developed by Riley, et al. (1999) to express the amount of elevation difference between adjacent cells of a DEM. Indicates the ruggedness of the terrain surrounding the cell. Scale-dependent.     
**TPI** (TPI): Topographic position index -- Calculates whether a raster cell is on a hill, valley, or in between. Positive TPI values represent locations that are higher than the average of their surroundings, as defined by the neighborhood (ridges). Negative TPI values represent locations that are lower than their surroundings (valleys). TPI values near zero are either flat areas (where the slope is near zero) or areas of constant slope (where the slope of the point is significantly greater than zero). Scale-dependent.   

### Landcover classes: These were calculated at the local level [local; pixel is in that class (1) or not (0)] and with a Gaussian filter at 250m (_G250) and 750m (_G750), where the value is the distance-weighted proportion of pixels in that land-cover class surrounding the point.
